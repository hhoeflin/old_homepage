Finished the Udemy-class
[`NGINX Fundamentals: High Performance Servers from Scratch`](https://www.udemy.com/course/nginx-fundamentals/learn/lecture/3667372#overview)
(see [certificate](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-a1a18ac5-f21e-4f15-b92b-731015837d4f/)).

Overall it was a very informative and well paced class that gives a good overview
on nginx and the different use cases. While likely not enough to really run production servers,
it gives enough knowledge on topics such as
- hosting a website
- redirecting traffic
- running workers for other services (such as PHP)
- traffic shaping
- authentication
- reverse proxy
- etc.
to put the student in a position to be able to look up the missing pieces on websites
or the nginx documentation. As the class is also just 4 hours of videos long, I can recommend it.

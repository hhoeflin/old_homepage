I just finished the Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree on Udacity 
([Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/SGETQ6EQ)). Reinforcement Learning
is a cutting edge research field where very important advances using Deep Learning
are being made very quickly. Some experts even believe that this can be the 
path to true artificial intelligence. 

For people who are not quite that far yet, I can recommend to have a look at the
[Open AI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) that is an excellent playground to try out some
algorithms.

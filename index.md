# Introduction

My name in Holger Hoefling and I am a Statistician, Machine Learner 
and Bioinformatician. For the last 9 years I have worked for Novartis
in various role, currently as the Lead of the machine learning
group in Scientific Data Analysis, NX, NIBR. 

In my career I have worked on a wide range of data science
problems in the healthcare field. This experience spans
from working on clinical study protocols, the development
of predictive algorithms for kidney disease to the
statistical analysis of experiments in early non-clinical
research with microarray, NGS and other biomarker data.

More recently I have been the leader of a team of
machine learners working on applications in cheminformatics
as well deep learning on histopathology images.

# Publications

In December 2019, we published the article A deep learning model of normal histology 
on [biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/838417v2). 

In this article we introduce deep learning models characterizing 
the diversity of normal histology. We show that the models 
can recognize a wide array of tissue types in rat with high accuracy and
the embeddings learned by the models also showed sub-clusters
of structures within tissues that the model did not explicitly learn. 
These embeddings can also be used to classify tissues in species 
other than rat with minimal retraining.

# hdf5r

An R package for reading and writing [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/)
data, implementing most of the functionality of the C-API in R. It
also has a convenient high-level interface that allows users to interact with it similar to regular arrays in R.

# Other interests

When I don't program for fun, I enjoy hiking, cycling as well as [archery](https://www.juventas.ch/clubdesk/www).
